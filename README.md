## üìñ How It Works

1. The app starts with two tabs: **WebView** and **Video Player**.
2. **WebView Screen**:
   - Loads an external site.
   - Sends a notification when the page finishes loading.
   - Includes buttons to trigger immediate or delayed notifications.
3. **Notification Handling**:
   - If a notification has a `url`, the app navigates to that screen automatically.
4. **Video Player Screen**:
   - Plays a default video stream.
   - Allows switching between multiple streams.
   - Includes mute/unmute functionality and a loading indicator.
